# Hextube-cuboid structure

Two cadnano files, using honeycomb and square lattice, respectively, converted by the Python Cadnano to UNF converter into one UNF file.  
The hextube is positioned inside the cuboid hole to test a multi-lattice assembly.  

**Generating UNF file from source files:**
```
cadnano_to_unf.py hc_hextube.json:honeycomb:100,100,0 sq_cuboid_hole.json:square:100,100,0
```
